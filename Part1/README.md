## Shopper Recurrence Rate metric calculation

Shopper Recurrence is a metric representing the percentage of customers who have made a purchase with a merchant in the most recent closed month and have also made a purchase with the same merchant at least once in the 12 months including the closed month. This metric is a key indicator of customer loyalty and repeat business, providing insights into the effectiveness of the merchantâ€™s offerings and customer engagement strategies.

The desired output should be the table `shopper_recurrence_rate` containing the following fields:

- `merchant_name`
- `month`
- `recurrence_rate`

### Analysis Objective

The main objective of the analysis is to calculate the recurrence rate of buyers for each specific month and merchant, evaluating how many buyers made recurring purchases with a merchant in a specific month and in the 12 months prior, including the month of analysis.

### Assumptions and comments to be shared

- The first assumption is that we are currently in January 2023, as the last closed month we have in the data is December 2022.
- We can only calculate recurrence for the months of December, November, and October because the last available month is September.
- Each row in the table represents a purchase, so to determine if a user has made a purchase in the last twelve months, we will directly check if they are present in any row in the last 12 months.
- I aimed to create a modular query using WITH expressions to make it structured, easy to understand, and easy to modify if necessary.
- I also wanted to create a query that is parameterizable and flexible so that by only changing the dates at the top, we can perform analyses for the months we want.
- The query we attached only loads results for one month; if we want to load historical data for several months, we would need to create a small process to automate it.
