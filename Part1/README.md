## Shopper Recurrence Rate metric calculation

Shopper Recurrence is a metric representing the percentage of customers who have made a purchase with a merchant in the most recent closed month and have also made a purchase with the same merchant at least once in the 12 months including the closed month. This metric is a key indicator of customer loyalty and repeat business, providing insights into the effectiveness of the merchantâ€™s offerings and customer engagement strategies.

The desired output should be the table `shopper_recurrence_rate` containing the following fields:

- `merchant_name`
- `month`
- `recurrence_rate`
